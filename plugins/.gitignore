# This directory exists to facilitate debugging in-situ and the creation of the install zip file.
# Since git keeps track of content, not directories, we put a .gitignore file in hear and ignore
# (from git's point of view) everything else in the directory. In a regular installation, this
# plugins directory contains the Python objects that gather sensor data. During development, I
# generally make links to the source files in their various directories in this directory so
# any changes I make here are recorded by git in the other directory.
